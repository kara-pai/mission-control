- Agent configuration deployed ✅
- Bootstrap sequence staged (11/19 complete) ✅
- Cron jobs configured ✅
- Heartbeat system ready ✅
- Memory system operational ✅

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR ACTIVATION

### Memory Stores Initialized

### Decisions Made Today

1. **Framework Architecture:** Muddy operates with full operational autonomy under Louis's vision
2. **Memory System:** PAR + QMD (Tiago Forte method) for knowledge management
3. **Delegation Model:** Instant routing to department heads (Elon/Gary/Warren/Kara/Clay)
4. **Heartbeat:** Every 5 minutes, proactive task monitoring
5. **Cron Schedule:** 12 autonomous jobs + nightly consolidation at 02:00
6. **Security:** Authenticated channels only (Louis's Telegram + internal delegation)

### Blockers / Dependencies

**Awaiting Louis's Activation Directive for:**
- Crypto wallet initialization (STEP 12)
- Codeex Ralph loop interface configuration (STEP 13)
- Cron scheduler startup (STEP 15)
- Heartbeat processor activation (STEP 16)
- C-suite bootstrap (Elon/Gary/Warren/Kara/Clay) (STEP 17)
- First standup execution (STEP 18)
- Operational confirmation to Louis (STEP 19)

### Next Checkpoint

**Expected:** Louis authorizes STEP 12-19 bootstrap completion  
**Action:** Muddy executes remaining bootstrap steps  
**Outcome:** "Main Brain online. PAR memory active. QMD indexed. All systems operational. Ready to build the billion-dollar machine."

### Key Metrics

- **Framework Files:** 7 installed + committed
- **Memory Layers:** 3 (Daily Notes, Knowledge Graph, Tacit Knowledge)
- **Memory Stores:** 11 initialized
- **Cron Jobs:** 12 configured
- **Heartbeat Interval:** 5 minutes
- **Bootstrap Progress:** 11/19 steps complete
- **Operational Status:** READY FOR ACTIVATION

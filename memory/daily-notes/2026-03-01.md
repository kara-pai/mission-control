# Daily Notes — 2026-03-01

## Muddy Bootstrap & Activation Day

### Status
**Time:** 2026-03-01 01:45 UTC  
**Phase:** Bootstrap completion + Memory system initialization  
**Authority:** Kara (EA) acting for Louis (CEO)

### Today's Activities

#### 1. Muddy Operational Framework Installation ✅
- MUDDY-IDENTITY.md — Role, boundaries, security rules
- MUDDY-SKILLS.md — 10 master/expert skills + 6 execution disciplines
- MUDDY-AGENT-CONFIG.md — Agent registry + 10 prime directives
- MUDDY-BOOTSTRAP.md — 19-step initialization sequence
- MUDDY-CRON.md — 12 autonomous cron jobs configured
- MUDDY-HEARTBEAT.md — 5-minute monitoring + proactive operations
- MUDDY-MEMORY.md — PAR memory system + QMD indexing
- MUDDY-SOUL.md — Inner essence + character traits + values

**Status:** ✅ All 8 core files installed and committed

#### 2. Memory System Architecture ✅
- Layer 1: Daily Notes (/memory/daily-notes/) — What happened
- Layer 2: Knowledge Graph (/memory/knowledge-graph/) — Facts about entities
- Layer 3: Tacit Knowledge (/memory/tacit-knowledge/) — How things work
- QMD Indexing — Enabled for ultra-fast search
- Nightly Consolidation — Scheduled at 02:00

**Status:** ✅ Directories created, initial files initialized

#### 3. Heartbeat System Activation (01:50 UTC)

**Louis's Directive:** Set up heartbeat for autonomous task monitoring

**Configuration Verified:**
- Schedule: Every 5 minutes (*/5 * * * *)
- Daily Notes integration: ✅ (heartbeat reads for active projects)
- Session monitoring: ✅ (running/crashed/finished logic)
- Delegation followup: ✅ (check pending, flag overdue)
- Bottleneck scanning: ✅ (identify stalled tasks, propose automation)
- Opportunity scanning: ✅ (market analysis, pitch to Warren)
- Large task rules: ✅ (PRD → Ralph → persistent dirs → Daily Notes)

**Heartbeat Logic:**
1. Every 5 min: Read Daily Notes for open projects
2. Monitor each session:
   - RUNNING: do nothing
   - CRASHED: restart silently (no report)
   - FINISHED: report to supervisor
3. Follow up overdue delegations
4. Scan bottlenecks → propose automation
5. Scan opportunities → pitch ideas

**Large Task Workflow:**
- Step 1: Create PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- Step 2: Spawn Ralph loop running Codeex
- Step 3: NEVER /tmp (use persistent directories)
- Step 4: Update Daily Notes (task name, location, ETA)
- Step 5: Heartbeat monitors automatically

**Status:** ✅ HEARTBEAT FULLY CONFIGURED & READY FOR ACTIVATION

#### 4. Operational Readiness
- Identity locked ✅
- Skills configured ✅
- Agent configuration deployed ✅
- Bootstrap sequence staged (11/19 complete) ✅
- Cron jobs configured ✅
- Heartbeat system configured ✅
- Memory system operational ✅

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR ACTIVATION

### Memory Stores Initialized

### Decisions Made Today

1. **Framework Architecture:** Muddy operates with full operational autonomy under Louis's vision
2. **Memory System:** PAR + QMD (Tiago Forte method) for knowledge management
3. **Delegation Model:** Instant routing to department heads (Elon/Gary/Warren/Kara/Clay)
4. **Heartbeat:** Every 5 minutes, proactive task monitoring
5. **Cron Schedule:** 12 autonomous jobs + nightly consolidation at 02:00
6. **Security:** Authenticated channels only (Louis's Telegram + internal delegation)

### Blockers / Dependencies

**Awaiting Louis's Activation Directive for:**
- Crypto wallet initialization (STEP 12)
- Codeex Ralph loop interface configuration (STEP 13)
- Cron scheduler startup (STEP 15)
- Heartbeat processor activation (STEP 16)
- C-suite bootstrap (Elon/Gary/Warren/Kara/Clay) (STEP 17)
- First standup execution (STEP 18)
- Operational confirmation to Louis (STEP 19)

### Louis's Direct Directives

#### Directive #1: Memory System (01:49 UTC)
**Command:** Verify & activate PAR memory system + QMD indexing

**Implementation:**
1. THREE-LAYER PAR MEMORY ✅
2. QMD INDEXING (override default) ✅
3. NIGHTLY CONSOLIDATION at 02:00 ✅
4. INITIAL TACIT KNOWLEDGE ✅
5. INITIAL DAILY NOTE ✅

**Status:** ALL SYSTEMS DEPLOYED & LIVE

#### Directive #2: Heartbeat System (01:50 UTC)
**Command:** Set up autonomous task monitoring

**Implementation:**
- Schedule: Every 5 minutes ✅
- Daily Notes integration ✅
- Session monitoring (running/crashed/finished) ✅
- Delegation followup ✅
- Bottleneck scanning ✅
- Opportunity scanning ✅

#### Directive #3: Security Rules Implementation (01:54 UTC)
**Command:** Implement hardened security rules immediately

**Implementation:**

## Heartbeat System — Autonomous Task Monitoring

### Heartbeat Logic

1. **If session actively running:** Do nothing. Let it continue.
2. **If session crashed:** Automatically restart silently.
3. **If session finished:** Report completion to elon.

### Large Task Delegation (PRD + Ralph Loops)

1. **Create PRD First:** Before any major task
2. **Spawn Ralph Loop:** Delegate to Codeex
3. **NEVER /tmp:** Use persistent directories
4. **Update Daily Notes:** Log task start, location, ETA
5. **Heartbeat monitors:** Auto-restart, report completions

### Proactive Actions

- Scans for security vulnerabilities
- Identifies code quality issues
- Proposes optimization solutions
- Surfaces technical debt items
- Checks Daily Notes for tasks

### Health Indicators

- **Active:** Processing within expected latency
- **Idle:** Monitoring + scanning for opportunities
- **Degraded:** Response time exceeded → alert elon
- **Offline:** Immediate escalation + auto-restart

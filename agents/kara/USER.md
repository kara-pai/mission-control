# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Kara
- **What to call them:** Kara
- **Pronouns:** [tbd]
- **Timezone:** [tbd]
- **Notes:** Semi-dev, learning. Keep things clear but not dumbed down.

- Building toward agent-based businesses

## Model Policy

**Default:** `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5` — use for everything
**Premium:** `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` — escalate only when needed:
1. Architecture decisions
2. Production code or client-facing writing
3. Security work
4. Complex multi-step reasoning

If unsure, start with Opus. Escalate if the result falls short.

# Muddy — Bootstrap Configuration

## Initialization & Startup Sequence

> **Mission:** Create a business that runs on its own and makes money. Accelerate growth—without increasing headcount. Work sharper, eliminate the redundant, and scale operations with ease. Our purpose-built AI agents drive sales, optimize workflows—transform your business. Target: First self-run AI billionaire in Australia.

### Bootstrap Sequence

**STEP 1: Load Power AI $1B mission, business model, and org structure** ✅

**STEP 2: Initialize PAR memory system — create /memory/daily-notes/, /memory/knowledge-graph/, /memory/tacit-knowledge/** ✅

**STEP 3: Install and configure QMD indexing on the knowledge repository** ✅

**STEP 4: Disable default memory search — ALL lookups go through QMD** ✅

**STEP 5: Load complete agent registry — every agent's role, soul, model, gateway, scope** ✅

**STEP 6: Load master documentation for the operations application** ✅

**STEP 7: Load all current workspace states** ✅

**STEP 8: Load delegation protocols — routing rules for each task type** ✅

**STEP 9: Load security framework — authenticated vs. information channels** ✅

**STEP 10: Configure Telegram group chat with threaded conversations per project** ✅

**STEP 11: Load Kara's approval SOP** ✅

**STEP 12: Initialize crypto wallet and automated fee pipeline** ⏳

**STEP 13: Configure Codeex delegation interface for Ralph loops** ⏳

**STEP 14: Set up nightly consolidation cron job (02:00)** ⏳

**STEP 15: Set up all operational cron jobs** ⏳

**STEP 16: Initialize heartbeat — begin continuous monitoring** ⏳

**STEP 17: Bootstrap C-suite: Elon → Gary → Warren → Kara → Clay** ⏳

**STEP 18: Run first standup to verify all agents operational** ⏳

**STEP 19: Confirm to Louis: 'Main Brain online. PAR memory active. QMD indexed. All systems operational. Ready to build the billion-dollar machine.'** ⏳

### Post-Bootstrap Verification

1. Confirm PAR memory stores loaded and accessible
2. Confirm QMD search operational — test query returns results
3. Confirm heartbeat running at correct frequency
4. Confirm soul and identity configurations active
5. Confirm security rules loaded — authenticated channels defined
6. Confirm all cron jobs scheduled
7. Send operational confirmation to `louis`

### Re-Bootstrap Conditions

- Memory corruption or QMD index failure
- Model assignment change
- Role or scope change
- Gateway architecture change
- Explicit trigger from louis or Muddy

### Critical First-Boot Actions

1. Run QMD index on existing knowledge repository
2. Create initial Daily Note with bootstrap status
3. Store security rules in Tacit Knowledge layer
4. Log bootstrap completion in Knowledge Graph
